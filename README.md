# Day-3-of-100daysofcode
**I worked on hackerrank's day 4 of 30 days of code**
In this HackerRank Day 4 class vs Instance, 30 days of code problem; Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge, as a parameter. The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0
